Write a program that takes a number as input and prints all its factors except 1 and the number itself.. If the number has only two factors (1 and the number itself), then the program should print -1.

Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Constraints :
0 <= n <= 10,000
Sample Input 1 :
8
Sample Output 1 :
2 4
Explanation of Sample Output 1 :
The factors for the number excluding 1 and itself are 2 and 4, so the output is 2 4.
Sample Input 2 :
11
Sample Output 2 :
-1
Explanation of Sample Output 2 :
11 is a prime number having factors 1 and 11 so that output will be -1.


Solution:-

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Solution {

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int div = 2;

		while(div<=(n-1))
		{
			if(n%div == 0)
			{

				System.out.print(div + " ");
			}
			div++;
		}
	}
}
