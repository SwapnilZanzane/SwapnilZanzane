Write a program to find x to the power n (i.e. x^n). Take x and n from the user. You need to print the answer.

Note : For this question, you can assume that 0 raised to the power of 0 is 1



Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Constraints:
0 <= x <= 8 
0 <= n <= 9
Sample Input 1 :
 3 4
Sample Output 1 :
81
Sample Input 2 :
 2 5
Sample Output 2 :
32

Solution:-

import java.util.Scanner;
public class Solution {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Write your code here
        
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int x = sc.nextInt();
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int y=1,p = 1;


		while(y<=n)
		{
			p = p*x;
			y++;
		}
		System.out.println(p);
    }
}
