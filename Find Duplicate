You have been given an integer array/list(ARR) of size N which contains numbers from 0 to (N - 2). Each number is present at least once. That is, if N = 5, the array/list constitutes values ranging from 0 to 3 and among these, there is a single integer value that is present twice. You need to find and return that duplicate number present in the array.

Note :
Duplicate number is always present in the given array/list.

Solution:-

public class Solution{	
	
    
	public static int duplicateNumber(int[] arr){
        int i,j,c;
        for(i=0;i<arr.length-1;i++){
            // c=0;
            for(j=i+1;j<arr.length;j++){
                if(arr[i]==arr[j])
                    return arr[i];
            }
            // if(c==2){
            //     return arr[i];
            // }
        }
        return 0;
    }
}
